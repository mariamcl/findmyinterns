I'm currently working on getting dual citizenship, which is a lot of paperwork! At some point, I want to drive across the United States and visit as many National Parks as I can. I also can't wait to see Gorillaz (one of my favorite bands) in concert when they tour later this year!","In the last 10 years, I've attended 8 different schools across 4 different countries.",I want to work with some technology or in some field that I don't have a whole lot of experience with and create something that I can brag about.,"This is a tough one, but I would have to say the most interesting place I've lived in would be Costa Rica. When I lived there, there were no street names, so my address wasn't anything like ""42 Hitchhiker Drive"", but more like ""From the former president Óscar Arias' house, south 300 meters, west 300 meters at the corner house with the palm trees and the fence.""
